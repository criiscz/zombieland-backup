# ZOMBIELAND - Beta

## MAJOR BUGS
  - The server don't work again if a player has been disconnected!.

## Start all the project in one command.
Dependencies:
  - Docker
  - Docker Compose
Just execute docker compose, which will run the `docker-compose.yml` file, this will start all the containers of the project at the same time.

```
docker-compose up
```
And nothing more, visit your `localhost:3000` to enter the game.
